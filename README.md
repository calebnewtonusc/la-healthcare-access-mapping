# LA Healthcare Access Mapping

Mapping healthcare access gaps across Los Angeles to identify underserved communities and inform resource allocation.

## Problem Statement

Many Los Angeles residents rely on emergency rooms for non-emergency issues due to limited access or awareness of urgent care options. Geographic gaps and uneven distribution of healthcare facilities create inefficiencies and strain on emergency resources.

## Project Goals

1. **Identify** neighborhoods in Los Angeles with limited access to urgent care facilities
2. **Analyze** access disparities using population density, distance, and facility availability
3. **Provide insights** that could inform resource allocation or outreach efforts

## Key Learning Objectives

- Retrieve and work with public health data using APIs and JSON-based sources
- Clean and process datasets with Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Perform geospatial analysis and compute access metrics
- Calculate facilities per capita and distance-to-care metrics
- Create meaningful visualizations of healthcare access patterns

## Data Sources

### Planned Data Sources

1. **Healthcare Facilities**
   - LA County Health Data (data.lacounty.gov)
   - California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal
   - Google Places API (urgent care, hospitals, clinics)

2. **Geographic Data**
   - LA County neighborhood boundaries (GeoJSON/Shapefiles)
   - Census tract data
   - ZIP code boundaries

3. **Population Data**
   - US Census Bureau API
   - American Community Survey (ACS) data
   - Population density by census tract

4. **Socioeconomic Indicators**
   - Median household income
   - Insurance coverage rates
   - Transportation access

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd la-healthcare-access-mapping
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up API keys (if needed):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys
```

## Usage

See [PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md) for detailed implementation phases and milestones.

### Quick Start

1. **Data Collection**: Run data collection scripts
```bash
python src/data_collection/fetch_facilities.py
```

2. **Data Processing**: Clean and prepare data
```bash
python src/data_processing/clean_data.py
```

3. **Analysis**: Run analysis scripts
```bash
python src/analysis/calculate_access_metrics.py
```

4. **Visualization**: Generate maps and charts
```bash
python src/visualization/create_maps.py
```

## Key Metrics

- **Facilities per capita**: Number of urgent care facilities per 10,000 residents
- **Average distance to nearest facility**: Mean distance from population centers
- **Coverage gaps**: Areas beyond 3-mile radius of any facility
- **Facility density**: Spatial clustering of healthcare resources
