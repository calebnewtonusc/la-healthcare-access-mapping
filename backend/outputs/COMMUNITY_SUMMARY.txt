📋 WHAT IS THIS REPORT?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report explains healthcare access in LA County in plain language. We analyzed
data from all 2,498 census tracts (neighborhoods) to find out where residents
have difficulty accessing healthcare facilities.

The goal is to identify WHERE new healthcare facilities are needed and WHAT actions
can improve access for everyone, especially communities that currently have the
longest distances to travel for care.


📊 CURRENT SITUATION IN LA COUNTY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✓ Total LA County Residents: 9,936,690 people
✓ Average Distance to Nearest Healthcare Facility: 1.0 kilometers (0.6 miles)

⚠️  42 neighborhoods (1.7%) are MORE THAN 5 KM (3.1 MILES) from healthcare
   → This affects 130,519 residents (1.3% of LA County)

🚨 25 neighborhoods are MORE THAN 10 KM (6.2 MILES) from healthcare
   → This is a CRITICAL ACCESS PROBLEM affecting 80,831 residents


💡 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN REAL LIFE?

When you live far from healthcare facilities:
• It's harder to see a doctor for regular checkups
