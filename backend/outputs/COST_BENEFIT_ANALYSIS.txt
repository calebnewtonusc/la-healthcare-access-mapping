═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY: $645.3M → $4.1B over 10 years (539.9% ROI)

This analysis evaluates four evidence-based interventions to improve healthcare
access for 320,530 underserved LA County residents living in access deserts
(>5km from nearest facility). All cost estimates use 2026 industry standards
from Becker's Hospital Review, RSMeans construction data, AHRQ quality reports,
and CMS reimbursement schedules.

KEY FINDINGS:

  ✓ MOST COST-EFFECTIVE: Healthcare Transportation Services
    → 10.26:1 benefit-cost ratio, immediate payback
    → Serves 291,663 active users, $375 cost per person over 5 years
    → Enables access without infrastructure investment

  ✓ HIGHEST IMPACT: New Healthcare Facilities
    → 4.64:1 benefit-cost ratio, 0.7-year payback
    → Serves 320,530 people, $1,256 cost per person over 10 years
    → Permanent solution reducing distance to care by 40-60%

  ⚠ EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Mobile Clinics & Telehealth
    → Not financially self-sustaining but serve vulnerable populations
    → Critical for health equity despite negative pure ROI
    → Should be evaluated on social value, not profit alone

RECOMMENDATION: Implement transportation and facilities (combined 5.6:1 ROI).
Consider mobile/telehealth as equity supplements with alternative funding.

RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 (Years 1-2): Quick Wins & Foundation
  ✓ Launch transportation program (immediate 10:1 ROI)
    Estimated Cost: $44M over 2 years
    Estimated Savings: $449M over 2 years

  ✓ Begin facilities planning & permitting (2-3 priority sites)
    Site selection, community input, environmental review

PHASE 2 (Years 3-5): Infrastructure Build-Out
  ✓ Construct first 5 healthcare facilities
    Estimated Cost: $96M (capital + 3 years operating)

  ⚠ Consider mobile clinics only if grant funding secured
    Pure county funding not cost-effective vs. facilities

PHASE 3 (Years 6-10): Completion & Optimization
  ✓ Complete remaining 5 healthcare facilities
  ✓ Expand transportation as utilization grows
  ⚠ Reassess telehealth based on Phase 1-2 outcomes

DEFERRED/ALTERNATIVE:
  • Mobile Clinics: Pursue only with 60%+ federal/state grant coverage
  • Telehealth Kiosks: Pilot home-based telehealth instead (lower cost)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES (10-Year Horizon)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Healthcare Access Improvements:
  • 320,530 residents with facility <5km (vs. current >10km)
  • 40-60% reduction in average distance to care
  • 31% reduction in missed appointments (transportation)
  • 8.5% reduction in preventable ER visits

Financial Performance:
  • $3.48B net benefit to LA County healthcare system
  • $1,248M from facilities (permanent infrastructure)
  • $1,013M from transportation (immediate impact)
  • Break-even achieved in Year 1 (transportation leads)

  • Addresses transportation barriers (41.7% no-vehicle areas)
  • Reduces health disparities by improving access to preventive care


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    PRIORITY RANKING BY COST-EFFECTIVENESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TIER 1: IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY (Positive ROI, High Impact)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ★★★★★ HEALTHCARE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
   Benefit-Cost Ratio: 10.26:1  |  Break-even: Immediate  |  Payback: 0.0 years

   Why: Highest ROI, serves largest population, fastest deployment, proven model.
   Every $1 invested returns $9.26 in savings. Can launch in 3-6 months using
   existing rideshare platforms. Addresses root cause (transportation barrier)
   without requiring new healthcare infrastructure.

   Risk: Low. Similar programs in Seattle and Boston show sustained 10-12% uptake.

2. ★★★★☆ NEW HEALTHCARE FACILITIES
   Benefit-Cost Ratio: 4.64:1  |  Break-even: 0.7 years  |  Payback: 8 months

   Why: Permanent solution with excellent ROI. Breaks even in <1 year and generates
   $1.25B profit over 10 years. Creates jobs, infrastructure, and long-term access.
   Addresses structural deficit in facility distribution.

   Risk: Medium. Requires zoning, permitting (6-12 mo), construction (18-24 mo),
   physician recruitment. Upfront capital intensive ($102M). Recommend phased
   rollout to manage cash flow and staffing.

TIER 2: IMPLEMENT WITH CONDITIONS (Equity Value, Grant Funding)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ★★☆☆☆ MOBILE HEALTH CLINICS
   Benefit-Cost Ratio: 0.68:1  |  Break-even: Never  |  Net Cost: $3.6M/5yr

   Why: Not financially self-sustaining but serves highest-vulnerability population
   (bottom 10% income, 41.7% no vehicle, 31% poverty). Health equity justification.
   Bridge solution while facilities are constructed.

   Recommendation: Implement ONLY if 60%+ grant funding secured (HRSA, Prop 1,
   private foundations). Otherwise, redirect funds to Tier 1 programs.

   Risk: Medium. Utilization depends on effective community outreach and route
   predictability. Lower continuity of care vs. fixed facilities.

4. ★☆☆☆☆ TELEHEALTH EXPANSION (KIOSKS)
   Benefit-Cost Ratio: 0.52:1  |  Break-even: Never  |  Net Cost: $745K/5yr

   Why: High upfront cost for limited utilization. Better alternatives exist
   (home-based telehealth serves 3× more people at 70% lower cost).

   Recommendation: DEFER kiosk approach. Instead, pilot home-based telehealth
   with equipment lending program and community health worker support. Reassess
   kiosks only for specialized use cases (mental health, language interpretation).

   Risk: High. Adoption uncertain, requires digital literacy, limited conditions
   appropriate for telehealth vs. in-person care.

LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠ This analysis uses best-available data and industry-standard cost models,
but actual outcomes will vary based on:

  1. Site-Specific Factors: Actual land costs, construction bids, permitting
     timelines vary significantly by location within LA County

  2. Utilization Uncertainty: Patient adoption depends on awareness, trust,
     cultural competency, language access, community engagement

  3. Staffing Challenges: Physician and nurse recruitment in underserved areas
     may require additional incentives beyond base salary

  4. Regulatory Changes: Healthcare reimbursement, telehealth rules, and public
     health policy may change over 10-year horizon

  5. Simplified Savings Models: Actual ER diversion and chronic disease outcomes
     depend on care quality, patient engagement, social determinants

  6. No Demand Elasticity: Assumes linear relationship between access and
     utilization; reality may show saturation effects

  7. Straight-Line Distances: Haversine calculations don't account for actual
     travel routes, traffic, public transit availability, topographic barriers

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (Overall Portfolio)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Case (+30% utilization, -10% costs):
  10-year ROI → 742%  |  Net Benefit → $4.8B  |  BCR → 8.45:1

Base Case (current assumptions):
  10-year ROI → 540%  |  Net Benefit → $3.5B  |  BCR → 6.40:1

Worst Case (-30% utilization, +10% costs):
  10-year ROI → 338%  |  Net Benefit → $2.2B  |  BCR → 4.38:1

Even under pessimistic assumptions, combined portfolio generates >300% ROI
and remains highly cost-effective. Transportation and facilities alone
(excluding mobile/telehealth) maintain >400% ROI in worst case.

                              CONCLUSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that strategic investment in healthcare
access infrastructure generates exceptional financial returns while addressing
critical health equity gaps in Los Angeles County.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

  1. ★ TRANSPORTATION IS THE HIGHEST-LEVERAGE INTERVENTION
     $22M/year investment → $225M/year savings (10:1 ratio)
     Serves 292K people, deploys in months, uses existing infrastructure

  2. ★ FACILITIES PROVIDE LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL SOLUTION
     $103M capital + $30M/year operating → $187M/year savings (4.6:1)
     Breaks even in 8 months, generates $1.2B profit over 10 years

  3. ⚠ EQUITY PROGRAMS NEED ALTERNATIVE FUNDING
     Mobile clinics and telehealth kiosks serve vulnerable populations but
     are not financially self-sustaining. Pursue only with grant support.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

IMMEDIATE (2026):
  → Allocate $22M for healthcare transportation program launch
  → Begin facility site selection and community engagement for 2-3 priority sites
  → Apply for HRSA grants to offset mobile clinic costs

NEAR-TERM (2027-2028):
  → Construct first 3 healthcare facilities in highest-priority locations
  → Scale transportation program based on Year 1 utilization data
  → Pilot home-based telehealth (lower cost alternative to kiosks)

LONG-TERM (2029-2036):
  → Complete all 10 healthcare facilities
  → Sustain transportation program at scale
  → Monitor health outcomes and adjust service mix

EXPECTED IMPACT:
  • 320,530 residents gain access to care within 5km (vs. current >10km)
  • 292K people enabled to reach appointments via subsidized transportation
  • $3.5B net benefit to LA County healthcare system over 10 years
  • 8.5% reduction in preventable ER visits
  • Significant progress toward healthcare equity goals

This investment aligns financial sustainability with public health impact,
generating both fiscal returns and measurable improvements in population health.
